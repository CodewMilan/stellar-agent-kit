# Warly — The Agentic Kit (Landing)

Landing page for **Warly: the agentic kit**, built with Vue 2 and [Fish-UI](https://myliang.github.io/fish-ui/).

## Setup

```bash
cd landing
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the URL Vite prints).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in `dist/`. Use `npm run preview` to serve it locally.

## Note

The main Stellar agent code lives in the parent repo (`src/`, `dist/`). This folder is a separate Vue 2 + Fish-UI app for the marketing/landing page only.
